# Data Structures and Algorithms using javascript

To be a good developer, one should have firm control over flow control, iteration, data structure etc. I am aiming to get started with DSA and then moving to leetcode to solve problems. This repo will be used to track my progress.

For a better basic understanding of DSA I am following a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coqQwbDezUA&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwjPxNAKvZpdnsr41E0fCMMP) on youtube by [CodeEvolution](https://www.youtube.com/@Codevolution). Codes related to this tutorial will be uploaded to tutorial folder.
